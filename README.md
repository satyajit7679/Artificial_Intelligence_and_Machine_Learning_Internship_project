**Documentation:**

This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify bank customers who are likely to churn (i.e., leave the bank). The model leverages NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and utilizes machine learning techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

**Key Features:**

Data Processing: Cleaning and preprocessing the customer data using Pandas and NumPy to prepare it for model training.
Feature Engineering: Crafting relevant features that help the model understand patterns in customer behavior.
Modeling: Applying various machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Artificial Intelligence: Incorporating AI techniques for model optimization and improving prediction accuracy.

**Repository Structure:**

data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks that document the step-by-step process of building the model.
models/: Saved machine learning models.
scripts/: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
results/: Outputs, including model performance metrics and visualizations.
